## CropMind – AI-Powered Agricultural Recommendation Engine

CropXpert is an AI-powered agricultural decision-support system using a Hybrid Prediction Algorithm that combines machine learning and an Agricultural Knowledge Engine. It analyzes 11 agricultural parameters to deliver personalized crop recommendations with explanations and confidence metrics. Built with FastAPI, React, scikit-learn, and MongoDB, it enables smart, data-driven precision farming.

## About
CropXpert is a cutting-edge AI-powered agricultural decision-support system leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques to provide personalized, data-driven crop recommendations. The system integrates a sophisticated Hybrid Prediction Algorithm (HPA) combining traditional machine learning classifiers with an Agricultural Knowledge Engine (AKE) to achieve superior accuracy in crop selection optimization.
The traditional approach relies heavily on farmer experience and basic soil testing, leading to suboptimal crop choices and reduced yields. CropXpert addresses this by providing automated intelligent analysis of 11 comprehensive agricultural parameters, delivering personalized recommendations within seconds with detailed explanations and confidence metrics.
The architecture uses a FastAPI backend, a React-based frontend, and scikit-learn classifiers for accurate prediction. Key features include professional authentication, comprehensive parameter input, a dual prediction system, detailed explanation reports (4-5 lines), and an integrated agricultural chatbot. The system uses MongoDB for efficient storage of user profiles and recommendation histories.
